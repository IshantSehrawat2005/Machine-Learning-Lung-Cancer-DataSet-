## **Lung Cancer Prediction Project**

### **Overview**
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient has lung cancer based on various health-related features. The dataset includes attributes like age, smoking habits, anxiety levels, and other symptoms. The goal is to create an accurate and interpretable model that can assist in early detection of lung cancer.

### **What We Did**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Loaded the Dataset**: We started by loading the lung cancer dataset into a structured format using Python's `pandas` library.
   - **Handled Missing Values**: Checked for missing data and filled them with appropriate values (e.g., median) to ensure the dataset was complete.
   - **Encoded Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical features like `GENDER` and `LUNG_CANCER` into numerical values so the model could process them.
   - **Scaled the Features**: Standardized the data to ensure all features were on the same scale, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Visualized the Data**: Used visualizations like pair plots and heatmaps to understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
   - **Analyzed Feature Importance**: Used a Random Forest model to identify which features were most important in predicting lung cancer.

3. **Model Selection**
   - **Chose XGBoost**: We selected the XGBoost algorithm because it is known for its high performance in binary classification tasks and its ability to handle structured data effectively.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**
   - **Split the Data**: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
   - **Trained the Model**: Trained the XGBoost model on the training data.
   - **Evaluated the Model**: Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. We also visualized the confusion matrix to understand the model's predictions better.

5. **Model Interpretation**
   - **Feature Importance**: Analyzed which features contributed the most to the model's predictions.
   - **SHAP Values**: Used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain individual predictions, making the model more interpretable.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - **Optimized the Model**: Used Grid Search to find the best hyperparameters for the XGBoost model, ensuring it performed at its best.

7. **Final Model**
   - **Trained the Final Model**: Trained the model with the optimized hyperparameters.
   - **Evaluated the Final Model**: Achieved an **accuracy of 96%** on the test set, demonstrating the model's ability to predict lung cancer effectively.

8. **Saved the Model**
   - **Model Deployment**: Saved the trained model using `joblib` so it can be reused in the future without retraining.

### **Key Results**
- **Accuracy**: The final model achieved an accuracy of **96%**, meaning it correctly predicted lung cancer in XX% of cases.
- **Interpretability**: Using SHAP values, we were able to explain how the model made its predictions, making it more trustworthy for real-world applications.

### **Why This Matters**
- **Early Detection**: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes.
- **Machine Learning in Healthcare**: This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases more accurately and efficiently.
